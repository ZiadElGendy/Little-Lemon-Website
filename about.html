				<p>
					Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who
					moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a
					restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his
					experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the
					restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic
					Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean
					region.
